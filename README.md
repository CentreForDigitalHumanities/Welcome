## Quick start
1. [Create a personal GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (not necessary if you already have a GitHub account).
2. Login to your personal GitHub account.
3. Make sure your GitHub account has [2FA enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)
4. [Connect to the organization](https://github.com/orgs/CentreForDigitalHumanities/sso) (one time only).
5. Authenticate using your Solis ID. This will make you a member of the organization and gives you permissions to create repositories and teams.
6. Go to https://github.com/CentreForDigitalHumanities and start working.
