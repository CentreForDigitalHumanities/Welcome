# Welcome

Welcome to the [Centre for Digital Humanities GitHub organization page](https://github.com/CentreForDigitalHumanities/).

## Quick start (CDH Employees)

Please note that membership of the CDH Github Organization is primarily reserved for members of the CDH and its affiliates. 
If you are otherwise connected to the Utrecht University, you are welcome to join the [Utrecht University Github organization](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity). This will also grant you (limited) access to our organization. 

1. [Create a personal GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (not necessary if you already have a GitHub account).
2. Login to your personal GitHub account.
3. Make sure your GitHub account has [2FA enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)
4. [Connect to the organization](https://github.com/orgs/CentreForDigitalHumanities/sso) (one time only).
5. Authenticate using your Solis ID. This will make you a member of the organization and gives you permissions to create repositories and teams.
6. Go to https://github.com/CentreForDigitalHumanities and start working.
7. (Optional) If you use SSH to clone repositories, you might need to authorize your SSH keys. This is done in your profile settings, under SSH and GPG keys (Configure SSO). 

## Access for non-CDH personel

If you are in possession of a Solis-ID, you can join the [Utrecht University Github organization](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity). This will also grant you (limited) access to our organization. 

In other cases, please contact us at [humanitiesit@uu.nl](mailto:humanitiesit@uu.nl) and we will find the best solution for you!
